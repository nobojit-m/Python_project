## Morse Code Generator

### Overview
The Morse Code Generator is a utility that allows users to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. It supports a wide range of characters, including letters, numbers, and special symbols, and provides an interactive command-line interface.

### Features
- Text to Morse code encoding
- Morse code to text decoding
- Comprehensive character support (A-Z, 0-9, and various special characters)
- Interactive menu for easy navigation
- Error handling for invalid inputs


2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - 1: Encode text to Morse code
   - 2: Decode Morse code to text
   - 3: Exit the program
3. Enter the text or Morse code when prompted, and the program will display the converted result.

### Future Enhancements
- Audio support for Morse code generation
- Visual learning tools and practice exercises
- File operations for batch processing and multiple file formats
- Web interface using Flask or Django
- Support for international Morse code variants
- Real-time translation from audio input
- Integration with other encoding systems (Binary, Semaphore, etc.)

## File Organizer

### Overview
The File Organizer is a Python script that automatically organizes files in a specified directory based on their extensions. It creates separate folders for different file types, helping users maintain a clean and organized directory structure.

### Features
- Automatically identifies file extensions
- Creates folders for different file types
- Moves files to appropriate folders
- Error handling for file operations
- Skips the script file itself to avoid conflicts


### Future Enhancements
- Custom folder mapping for specific file types
- File type categorization based on user-defined rules
- Undo functionality to revert changes
- GUI interface for easier user interaction

## Installation
All projects require Python 3.x to run. No additional dependencies are needed for the basic functionality. However, for the Windows blocker feature in the Pomodoro Timer, you'll need to install `pywin32`:
